This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of a Vector Database for efficient data storage, retrieval, and similarity search. Vector databases are widely used in AI, machine learning, recommendation systems, and search engines to store and query high-dimensional data efficiently.

## üìå Methodology:
The notebook follows a structured approach to working with vector databases:

Data Preparation: Converts input data into high-dimensional vectors using embeddings.
Vector Storage: Stores vectors in a specialized database optimized for fast similarity searches.
Querying & Retrieval: Uses similarity metrics (cosine similarity) to retrieve the most relevant vectors.
Use Cases: Demonstrates real-world applications such as document retrieval, recommendation systems, and semantic search.
## üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:
Python: For scripting and implementation.
Vector Embeddings: Generated using pre-trained models or custom feature extraction techniques.
Vector Database: Utilizes a specialized database like FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, or an alternative to store and manage vectors.
Similarity Search Algorithms: Implements nearest neighbor search techniques for fast and accurate retrieval.
